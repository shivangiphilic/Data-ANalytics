# Data-Analytics
Python Projects - NumPy Pandas
These are projects that use Python Library functionality to clean and organise big data. 

Project 1 - EDA
The data about movies was sourced from Kaggle and cleaned using the Py warnings library. We got the metadata using Python DataFrames. Then, the visualization of the plots and table were using matplotlib.

Project 2 - Univariate Visualisation
From an Excel file containing data from a hospital, the plots are made using seaborn and matplotlib.
